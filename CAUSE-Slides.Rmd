ggplot() + geom_emoji("woman_teacher") + theme_void()
```

To take the best action or causal conclusion based on multivariate (observational) data analysis:

- Data is not just there - it has a generating process and we should care about this.

- Confounding and bias can be serious issues for causal inference.

- Adjusting or not adjusting: Both  can be bad ideas for causal inference.

- Structural causal models and directed acyclic graphs can help to build a bridge between reality, theory and data.

- Quantitative model checks may not reveal which model is best for causal inference (*only claimed, but true nevertheless*).

# Real data example

## Saratoga Houses

Data on houses in Saratoga County, New York, USA in 2006. Analysis in `R`:

```{r SaratogaSP, out.width = "35%", fig.align="center"}
# Load package and read in data 
library(mosaic); data(SaratogaHouses)
# Scatterplot
gf_point(price ~ bedrooms, data = SaratogaHouses) %>%
  gf_lm(interval = "prediction")
```

.small[Idea: [De Veaux (2019). *Data Science for All*](https://iase-web.org/conference/satellite19/docs/Data%20Science%20for%20All.pdf)]


---

## Modelling value of my 2-bedroom house

Linear Model: ${\text{price}}_i = {\beta}_0 + {\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}} \times \text{bedrooms}_i + \epsilon_i$:

```{r}
# Linear Regression
my.model <- lm(price ~ bedrooms, data = SaratogaHouses); my.model 
```

So: $\hat{\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}}=`r round(coef(my.model)[2],2)`$

--

```{r}
# My house: 2 bedrooms; Point prediction
My.House <- data.frame(bedrooms = 2); predict(my.model, newdata = My.House)
```

$$\widehat{\text{price}}^{|\text{bedrooms}=2} \approx `r round(predict(my.model, newdata = My.House))`$$


---

## Turn data into money

```{r, echo= FALSE , out.width = "15%", fig.align="center"}
ggplot() + geom_emoji("money_mouth_face") + theme_void()
```

Split one bedroom into three!

--

```{r}
# My rebuilt house: now 4 bedrooms
My.NewHouse <- data.frame(bedrooms = 4)
# My money (?)
predict(my.model, newdata = My.NewHouse) - predict(my.model, newdata = My.House)
```

So:

$$\widehat{\text{price}}^{|\text{bedrooms}=4} - \widehat{\text{price}}^{|\text{bedrooms}=2} = (4-2) \times \hat{\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}}=`r 2*round(coef(my.model)[2],2)`$$

---

## Really?

Make three bedrooms out of one and the value of my house goes up by $\approx 100.000$ Dollar?

.small[[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/debate-donald-trump-septgopdebate2015-xTiTnHXbRoaZ1B1Mo8)]


---

## Causal Model (simplified)

The number of bedrooms depends on the house size - as well as the price (**confounding**/ **lurking** variable):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align="center"}
DAG_Immo
```


---

## Omitted-variable bias

Ok, let's **adjust** for `livingArea`:

```{r}
my.adj.model <- lm(price ~ bedrooms + livingArea, data = SaratogaHouses); my.adj.model
```

Now: $\hat{\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}}=`r round(coef(my.adj.model)[2],2)`$ (instead of $\hat{\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}}=`r round(coef(my.model)[2],2)`$ unadjusted for ` livingArea`). So: price falls instead of rises if I split a bedroom. (**Simpson's Paradox**)

<br>

--

No problem, just use a fancy-machine-learning-method with all variables? (And be aware of bias-variance trade off.)

Unfortunately quantitative measures like e.g. cross-validated mean squared error **not always** tell you which model is best for causal inference.

# Simulated example

## Dating

**Assume** you date someone because he is good looking or because he is kind. Moreover assume that looking and kindness are independent.


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align="center"}
DAG_Date
```


---

## Data generating process

$$X = U_X, \quad U_X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,1),$$
$$Y = U_Y, \quad U_Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,1),$$
$$\widetilde{C} =\begin{cases} 1 & ,\, \text{if } \{ X > 1 \,\vee\, Y > 1\} \\ 0 & ,\, \text{else } \end{cases},$$
$$C = (1-U_C) \cdot \widetilde{C} + U_C \cdot (1- \widetilde{C}), \quad U_C \sim \mathcal{B}(0.05).$$
where $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\,\sigma)$ stands for Normal distribution and $\mathcal{B}(\pi)$ for the Bernoulli distribution.

In `R`:

```{r}
set.seed(1896)

kind<- rnorm(1000)
look <- rnorm(1000)
dating <- ((kind > 1) | (look > 1)) 
luck <- rbinom(1000, size = 1, prob = 0.05)
dating <- (1 - luck) * dating + luck * (1 - dating)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
Date <- data.frame(kind, look, dating=(dating==1))
```

---

## Modelling: Marginal

Modelling of `kind` by `look`:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.asp = 0.8, fig.align="center"}
ggformula::gf_point(kind~look, data = Date) %>%
  gf_lm() + ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind()
```


---

## Modelling: Conditional

Modelling of `kind` by `look`, adjusted for `dating`:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.asp = 0.8, fig.align="center"}
ggformula::gf_point(kind~look, color=~dating, data = Date) %>%
  gf_lm() + ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind()
```

- Adjusted for the common effect (dating) there is an association between the independent causes good looking and kindness (**Berkson's Paradox**).

- Formally: $\texttt{kind}{\perp\!\!\!\perp}\texttt{look}$ *but* $\texttt{kind} \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp \texttt{look}|\texttt{dating}$

---

## Selection/ Collider Bias

Modelling of `kind` by `look`, selected by `dating`:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.asp = 0.8, fig.align="center"}
Dated <- Date %>% filter(dating==TRUE)
ggformula::gf_point(kind~look, data = Dated) %>%
  gf_lm() + ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind()
```

- There is also an association between the independent causes good looking and kindness if your data consists only of those who you dated - if good looking was not the reason, it must have been kindness (or luck).

## Levels of causal inference


[Pearl (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3241036) establishes a three-level hierarchy:

- **Association**: $P(y|x)$: Seeing: *what is?*, i.e., the probability of $Y=y$ given that we observe $X=x$.

- **Intervention**: $P(y|do(x))$: Manipulation: *what if?*, i.e., the probability of $Y=y$ given that we intervene and set the value of $X$ to $x$.

- **Counterfactuals**: $P(y_x|x',y')$: Imagining: *what if I had acted differently?*, i.e., the probability of $Y=y$ if $X$ had been $x$ given that we actually observed $x',y'$.



<br>

Other approaches to causal inference are e.g. within potential outcome framework, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, Granger, natural experiments, ...

---

## One page of theory

- $X \rightarrow Y: \quad Y=f(X, U_Y)$ with some function $f(\cdot)$ and some exogenous $U$. 

- The value of $Y$ depends on $X$ - but the value of $X$ **not** on $Y$. 

- Causally there is no inverse function $f^{-1}(\cdot)$. My weight growths with my height but unfortunately my height not with my weight.

<br>



| Path                       | $X \rightarrow C \rightarrow Y$ | $X \leftarrow C \rightarrow Y$ | $X \rightarrow C \leftarrow Y$ 
| ---------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Name                       | Chain                           | Fork                           | Collider         
| Association $X$ to $Y$     | Causal                          | Non-causal                     | None                       
| Role of $C$                | Mediator                        | Cause                          | Effect
| Adjusting $C$              | Blocks causal path              | Blocks non-causal path         | Opens biasing path


<br>

**Idea**: To estimate the change in $y$ if $x$ is changed: Block non-causal paths, open causal paths and don't open a biasing path.

# Teaching Causal Inference

class: center, inverse, middle

## [Witmer (2020):](https://doi.org/10.1080/00029890.2020.1671757) The  scientific  community  would  benefit  greatly  from  a  better  understanding of causal inference - and "better" is quite a low bar, given how little the tools of causal reasoning have been used over the years. But statisticians have stood in the way, insisting that cause-and-effect conclusions can only be drawn from randomized experiments and delighting in telling stories about confounded effects that arise when analyzing observational data, all while repeating the  mantra  that correlation is  not  causation. In so doing, we statisticians congratulate ourselves too much, while turning students away from asking and answering questions of genuine interest.

- Is it a good idea to show oversimplified examples in class? Real causal inference is much harder.

- Are we overstraining our students?

- Simulated data, really?

- What about the topics ommited: Is causal inference making up the opportunity costs?

- What happens if our students change university and have learned different topics than in a consensus curriculum?

- Is it a good idea to teach something that most of us have not learned as a student?

- On the other hand, are we answering the important questions for data literacy in the consensus curriculum?
